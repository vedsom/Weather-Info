# Weather Information API

## Project Overview

This project provides a REST API for fetching weather information for a specific date and pincode. The API integrates with OpenWeather API to get the weather data and optimizes API calls by caching location and weather data in a relational database. This approach minimizes unnecessary API calls by saving latitude, longitude, and weather information, ensuring that repeated requests for the same pincode are faster and more efficient.

## Key Features
- **Weather Information API**: Accepts a pincode and a specific date as input to provide weather information for that day.
- **Pincode to Latitude/Longitude**: The API utilizes the OpenWeather Geocoding API to convert the pincode into latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Weather Data Caching**: The API stores weather data for each pincode in a MySQL database, ensuring optimized API calls for future requests.
- **Optimized for API Calls**: The system minimizes unnecessary API calls by caching data (latitude, longitude, and weather) in the database, ensuring faster responses for subsequent requests.
- **Testable via Postman or Swagger**: This API can be tested using Postman or Swagger, with no UI required.

## Database Schema
1. **Location Table**: Stores the pincode, latitude, and longitude.
   - Fields: `id`, `pincode`, `latitude`, `longitude`
   
2. **WeatherInfo Table**: Stores weather information for each pincode on a particular date.
   - Fields: `id`, `pincode`, `date`, `weather_description`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `wind_speed`

## API Workflow
1. **Input**:
   - `pincode`: The pincode for which weather data is requested.
   - `for_date`: The date for which the weather data is needed (format: `yyyy-mm-dd`).

2. **Processing**:
   - Convert the pincode into latitude and longitude using OpenWeather Geocoding API.
   - Fetch the weather data using the OpenWeather API for the obtained latitude and longitude.
   - Save the pincodeâ€™s latitude, longitude, and the corresponding weather data in the database for future requests.
   
3. **Output**:
   - The weather information for the given pincode and date, including:
     - Weather description
     - Temperature
     - Humidity
     - Wind speed

4. **Optimized Calls**: If the data for the given pincode and date is already available in the database, the system will return cached results without making an API call.

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Set up the database and import the schema:
   - Create a MySQL database and import the provided SQL schema to set up tables (`Location` and `WeatherInfo`).

3. Configure application properties:
   - Set the necessary environment variables (e.g., OpenWeather API key, database connection).

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

## Testing with Postman or Swagger
1. **Postman**:
   - Create a new POST request to `http://localhost:8080/weather` with parameters `pincode` and `for_date`.
   
2. **Swagger**:
   - Swagger UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/` to test the API endpoints interactively.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: RDBMS for storing location and weather data.
- **OpenWeather API**: For fetching weather data based on latitude and longitude.
- **Postman/Swagger**: Tools for testing and interacting with the API.
